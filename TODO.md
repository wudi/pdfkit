# PDF writer completeness checklist

Status key: Not started / In progress / Done.

- [ ] File structure: emit versioned header, unique file ID, body objects, xref table/stream with correct byte offsets, trailer with Size/Root/Info/ID/Encrypt, `%%EOF`, and incremental update support. Status: In progress (versioned headers, Info/Metadata references, trailer IDs, xref streams, and append-mode writes with Prev are implemented; full incremental merge of prior objects still pending).
- [x] Object model: cover all primitive types (null/bool/number/string/name/array/dict/stream/indirect refs), indirect serialization, generation numbers, and reuse. Status: Done (literal and hex strings encoded, primitive serialization covers arrays/dicts/streams/refs, and deduped reusable font objects).
- [ ] Page tree: build Catalog/Pages hierarchy with Count/Kids, media/trim boxes, rotation, and inherited Resources. Status: In progress (MediaBox/CropBox/TrimBox/BleedBox/ArtBox geometry, rotation, UserUnit, and Pages-level font resources emitted; other resource inheritance still pending).
- [ ] Content streams: encode filters (Flate/ASCIIHex/ASCII85; optionally LZW/RunLength/JPX/JBIG2), lengths, and operators for text/graphics state/paths/shadings/images/forms/annotations. Status: In progress (content streams can now be Flate/ASCIIHex/ASCII85/RunLength/LZW encoded with correct Length/Filter and serialize semantic operations).
- [ ] Resources: handle fonts (Type1/TrueType/CID with encodings and widths), color spaces, patterns, shadings, XObject forms/images, ExtGState, proc sets. Status: In progress (basic Type1 font objects emitted and deduplicated; ProcSet emitted; advanced font data and other resources pending).
- [ ] Metadata & outlines: document info dictionary, XMP metadata stream, outlines/bookmarks, page labels, ViewerPreferences, article threads. Status: In progress (Info dictionary writes title/author/subject/creator/producer/keywords; ViewerPreferences sets DisplayDocTitle when Title present; page labels emitted via Nums; outlines emitted with Dest/Prev/Next/First/Last for children plus PageMode UseOutlines; XMP metadata streams implemented; article threads pending).
- [ ] Annotations & forms: annotations (links/text/widgets) with appearance streams; AcroForm fields/apparences/NeedAppearances. Status: In progress (link annotations with Rect/URI and borders; text annotations with Contents; AcroForm emitted with NeedAppearances/Fields placeholder).
- [ ] Encryption/security: Encrypt dictionary with Standard handler (keys/permissions); embedded file specs if needed. Status: Not started.
- [ ] Compliance: PDF/A tagging (StructTreeRoot), role maps, font consistency, OutputIntents, downgrade/clip to target level. Status: In progress (StructTreeRoot emitted with RoleMap when provided; rest pending).
- [ ] Validation/robustness: length bounds, offset consistency, deterministic ordering, malformed stream avoidance, readback tests. Status: In progress (xref table startxref offsets validated; deterministic ordering for dict keys and IDs in place).
